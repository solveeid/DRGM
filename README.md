# DRGM
Implementation of the discrete Riemmanian gradient methods (DRGM), for two conservative systems.

This code is meant as a supplement to [1], and is an implementation of different discrete Riemannian gradient methods. The first code file, spinningtop.m, considers Example 1 in [1]: a nonlinear perturbation of a spinning top, where the manifold is the 2-sphere.
The second code file, particle_on_paraboloid.m, is an implementation of Example 2 in [1]: a particle of unit mass moving under a gravitational field on an elliptic paraboloid.

Recommended packages/tools: None.

This is the first release, so if you have comments and suggestions for improvements, please contact me and I will try to accommodate them.
