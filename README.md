# DRGM
Implementation of the discrete Riemmanian gradient methods (DRGM), for two conservative systems.

Recommended packages/tools: None.

This code is meant as a supplement to [1], and is an implementation of different discrete Riemannian gradient methods.

This is the first release, so if you have comments and suggestions for improvements, please contact me and I will try to accommodate them.
